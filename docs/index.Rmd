# Markdown

Markdown is a way to make fancy documents. 
Make sure you "Knit" often -- after every major change -- to mitigate errors. 
Hashtags are how we make levels of a doc. 

## Next Level
### Next level
#### Fourth level
##### etc. 

# Basic formatting 

This is **bold** (that's double asterisks). Or *italics*. Or `code`. 

- this is the start of a list. 
- next item. 
- next item. make sure you have a space at the end of item. 

1. this is a numbered list. 
2. second item. 

To add a hyperlink, do `[link text](url)`. 
For example, [go to the Sewanee website](https://www.sewanee.edu). 

To link to sections of your document, do `[link text](#section-name)`. 
For example, go to [Markdown](#markdown). 
^keep in mind, no backticks, all lowercase, _ instead of spaces. 

To add more vertical spaces between blocks ot text, use this: `&nbsp;`, with lines between them. 

&nbsp; 

&nbsp; 

Should be more space now. 

**To include an image -- fun!**
First put an image inside the folder where you `Rmd` file is located. 
Then type `![](../images/full_image_filename_here){width="50%"}` 

![](../images/test_image.jpg){width="50%"}

# RMarkdown

`RMarkdown` is just `Markdown` with `R` woven in. 

You can do R stuff in the same line as text. For example `r 3+3` will show as 6. 
(That looks like backtick, lower-case-r, space, code, backtick). 

You can also do a full-multi-line CHUNK of R stuff:
Create with ` ```{r}` on the first line and ` ``` ` on the last. 

```{r}
3+3
```

Settings to control how R chunks appear:

- `eval=TRUE`: which actually runs the code; if `eval=FALSE`, it shows the code but doesn't run it. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#this will be shown but not evaluated 
3+3
```

- `echo=TRUE`: which shows the code; if `echo=FALSE`, the code can run without being seen. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
#this will be evaluated but now shown
4+4
```

- `warnings=FALSE`: which will turn off warning. 

- `fig.cap = "figure caption"` adds a figure caption. 

- `fig.width = 7` example of figure width. 

- `fig.height = 4` example of figure height. 

# Bringing in real data

To manually set working directory while building up my RMarkdown file, just fo to Section > Set working directory > Source file locations. 

```{r read data, }
library(readr)
energy <- read_csv("../data/IRENA data.csv", skip=1) #`skip=` to skip the first row at the top that is not actual data 
```

```{r explore data, }
library(dplyr)
energy %>% names
energy %>% head
energy %>% tail
energy %>% pull(Technology) %>% unique %>% sort
```

### Filtering code now
Here is a new section where I talk about what I's doing. 

```{r}
#filter data
fenergy <- energy %>% 
  filter(`Country/area` == "Germany")
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
p <- ggplot(fenergy,
       aes(x = Year,
           y = as.numeric(`Electricity statistics`),
           fill = Technology))+
  geom_area()
ggplotly(p)
```
